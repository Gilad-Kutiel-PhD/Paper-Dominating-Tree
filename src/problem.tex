In this section we show that \Prob{} is equivalent to \ProbGroup{} from 
approximation perspective, 
that is every approximation algorithm to one problem yields the same approximation 
ratio for the other problem.
To show this we introduce approximation preserving reductions from \Prob{} to \ProbGroup{}
and vice-versa.
