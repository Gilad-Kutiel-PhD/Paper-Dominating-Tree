Recall that an instance of \ProbGroup{} is a tuple $(G, w, \mathcal{G})$,
where $G = (V, E)$ is an undirected graph, $w:E \to \mathcal{R}$ is a weight function, 
and $\mathcal{G} \subseteq 2^V$ is a family of groups of vertices.
A Steiner group tree of is a sub-tree of $G$, $T = (U, F)$
such that $g \cap U \neq \emptyset$ for each $g \in \mathcal{G}$.
The cost of such tree is $\sum_e \in F w(e)$.
Given an instance of \ProbGroup{} we are looking for a minimum cost Steiner group tree
of $G$.

In this section we show that \Prob{} is equivalent to \ProbGroup{} from 
approximability perspective, 
that is every approximation algorithm to one problem yields the same approximation 
ratio for the other problem.
To show this we introduce approximation preserving reductions from \Prob{} to \ProbGroup{}
and vice-versa.
