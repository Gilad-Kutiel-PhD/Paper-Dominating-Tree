We now show how to reduce \ProbStar{} to an instance of the \ProblemSetCover{} problem
(\ProbSetCover{}) in order to obtain a $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm.
This is the best one can hope for if $P \neq NP$.

Without loss of generality, we assume that the center of the dominating star is known,
or otherwise we can solve the problem for every vertex in the graph assuming it is 
the center.  
Given an undirected weighted graph $(G, w)$ and a the center of the dominating star
$c \in V$ we create the following an instance of \ProbSetCover{} 
$(U, \mathcal{S}, w')$ as follow:
\begin{description}
\item[$U$] - $V \setminus N(c)$
\item[$\mathcal{S}$] - $\{S_v : cv \in E\}$
\item[$S_v$] - $N(v) \cap U$
\item[$w'$] - $w'(S_v) = w(cv)$ 
\end{description}
Clearly the above transformation can be done in polynomial time,
The following two claims show that this is an approximation preserving reduction:

\begin{claim}
If $S = (c, L)$ is a dominating star in $G$ then 
$\mathcal{C} = \{S_v : v \in L\}$ is a set cover in $(U, \mathcal{S}, w')$,
moreover, $w(S) = w'(\mathcal{C})$.  
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
$w(S) = w'(\mathcal{C})$ by construction.
Now, assume for contradiction that $\mathcal{C}$ is not a set cover and let $v$
be an uncover element then $v$ is also not dominated by $S$ - contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
If $\mathcal{C}$ is a set cover in $(U, \mathcal{S}, w')$ 
then $S = (c, \{v : S_v \in \mathcal{C}\})$ is a dominating star in $G$,
moreover, $w(S) = w'(\mathcal{C})$.  
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
$w(S) = w'(\mathcal{C})$ by construction.
Now, assume for contradiction that $S$ is not a dominating star and let $v$
be an undominated vertex then $v$ is also uncovered by $\mathcal{C}$ - contradiction.
\end{proof}
