We now show an approximation-preserving reduction from \ProbGroup{} to
\Prob{}.
Given an instance of \ProbGroup{}, $(G, w, S, \mathcal{G})$, where $G = (V, E)$, 
we define an instance of \Prob{},
$(G', w')$ where $G' = (V', E')$.

From left to right:
a) An instance of \ProbGroup{} (weights are omitted), 
groups are marked by a dashed blue and dotted green lines respectively.  
b) A corresponding \Prob{} instance: we add a vertex for each group and connect it 
with infinity weighted edges to all terminals in the group.
