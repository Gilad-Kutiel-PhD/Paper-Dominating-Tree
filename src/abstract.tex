Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and a weight function $w:E \to \R$, the \Problem{} problem asks to find a minimum weight sub-tree of $G$, $T = (U, F)$, such that every $v \in V \setminus U$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $U$.The special case when the weight function is uniform is known as the \textsc{Minimum Connected Dominating Set} problem.Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with some subsets of vertices called groups,and a weight function $w:E \to \R$,the \textsc{Group Steiner Tree} problem is to find a minimum weight sub-treeof $G$ which contains at least one vertex from each group. In this paper we show that the two problems are equivalents from approximation algorithms perspective.This improves upon both the best known approximation algorithm and the best inapproximability result for the \Problem{} problem.  We also show that the \Problem{} problem is NP-hard even when we are looking fora minimum dominating star, and that it cannot be approximated within $c\log n$ ratiofor some $c > 0$ unless $P = NP$.
