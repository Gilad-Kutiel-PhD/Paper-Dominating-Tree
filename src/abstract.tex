Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and a weight function $w:E \to \R$, the \Problem{} problem asks to find a minimum weight sub-tree of $G$, $T = (U, F)$, such that every $v \in V \setminus U$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $U$.The special case when the weight function is uniform is known as the \textsc{Minimum Connected Dominating Set} problem. In this paper we give a $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the problemwhich is the best possible unless $P = NP$.We also show that this is the best possible result even when we are looking fora minimum dominating star.
