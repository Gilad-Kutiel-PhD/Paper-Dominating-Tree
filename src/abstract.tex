Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and a weight function $w:E \to \R$, the \Problem{} problem asks to find a minimum weight sub-tree of $G$, $T = (U, F)$, such that every $v \in V \setminus U$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $U$.The special case when the weight function is uniform is known as the \textsc{Minimum Connected Dominating Set} problem.Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with some subsets of vertices called groups,and a weight function $w:E \to \R$,the \textsc{Group Steiner Tree} problem is to find a minimum weight sub-treeof $G$ which contains at least one vertex from each group. In this paper we show that the two problems are equivalentfrom the perspective of approximability.This improves upon both the best known approximation algorithm and the best inapproximability result for the \Problem{} problem.We also consider two extrema variants of the \Problem{} problem, namely,the \ProblemStar{} and the \ProblemPath{} problems which ask to find a minimum dominating star and path respectively.
