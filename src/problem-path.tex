We show that the \ProblemPath{} problem (\ProbPath{}) cannot be approximated at all
unless $P = NP$.
We show a reduction from the \ProblemHam{} problem (\ProbHam{}).
In \ProbHam{} we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and we are 
asked to decide if there is an Hamiltonian path 
(a simple path traversing all the vertices in $V$) in $G$ or not.
\ProbHam{} is one of the classical NP-hard problems.
