Our result shows that on general graphs any approximation algorithm for
the \Problem{} problem yields the same approximation result for the 
\ProblemGroup{} problem and vice versa.
This result might give another perspective and maybe shed some light on
the \ProblemGroup{} problem.

We remark, however, that the two problems are not equivalent.
A good example is when the input graph is a tree, \ProbGroup{} is known to 
be as hard to approximate as \ProbSetCover{} even in this case while \Prob{} is 
trivially solvable on trees.
Thus, there is also a place to studying each of the problems on its own for particular 
families of graphs.
