In this section we consider the \ProblemStar{} problem, 
that is the \Problem{} problem when restricted to stars, i.e.
given an undirected weighted graph $(G, w)$ find a 
minimum weight dominating sub-star (a tree with diameter at most 2).
We start by showing that this problem cannot be approximated 
within $c\log n$ for some $c > 0$ unless $P = NP$.
Then we show how to reduce the problem to a set cover instance to achieve a 
$O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm.
